Comany has distributes business and clients from various cities. So to maintian the website we will create microservices for each city(as we have 12 offices in 12 cities).It will be easy to make the microservice for each city than building entire site as single unit.This microservie architecture will help in maintaince as in future cutomers are added/removed so we need to modify only that city's microservice. we will host this on public cloud such as google cloud platform.If we want to add new city in our website than we will create a new microservice for that city.No need to modify basic design of website.any employeecan access any citys information and also the development of such kind of architecture will result in faster development.
